# Portfolio_using_HTML
I have made my portfolio using HTML file only .
without css file it was challenging to make an attractive and responsive HTML page, but I have tried it and result was not bad despite i was facing shortage in content but it was managed at last by providing form for contacts at the end.
IT is my new journey in github with this exciting portfolio project.
